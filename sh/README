The application can create mongo clusters in amazon cloud.

Prerequisites
-------------
1/ libxml2-utils package installed (on ubuntu distribution, on other linux distributions can have another name).On mac os it should be installed by default.You can run "xmllint --version" command to check if the tool is installed.
2/ wget tool installed
3/ a valid Amazon EC2 account
4/ Ports 4440, 8181 must be free.

The app is compatible with ubuntu distribution (maybe other linux distributions too, not tested yet) and mac Os.

Installation
-------------

1/Launch install.sh script.
2/Configure the AWS credentials in org.apache.provisionr-04.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/org.apache.provisionr.amazon.cfg

Usage
-------------

For launching the app launch startServers.sh script.
For stopping the app execute stopServers.sh.

For creating a cluster in amazon use the createCluster.sh script as bellow:
Example: ./createCluster.sh -s 3 -m 2 (will create a cluster with 3 shards and 2 mongos platforms)

For destroying the cluster execute destroyCluster.sh script.
Example: ./destroyCluster.sh (will destroy the current cluster)

Use clusterStatus.sh for printing the cluster details (like IPs).

You can have only one cluster.The app cannot manage multiple clusters in the same time.
